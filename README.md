`remark-interactive-words` is a plugin for `remark`. It's built to facilitate Aided Reading (AR) on digital devices.

## Intro

Designed to transform markdown by replacing [words](#) with interactive, clickable links with a `#slug` for programatic use, `remark-interactive-words` is developed by [Russ Fugal](https://sara.ai/about.html) for [SARAs Books LLC](https://sara.ai) to support Aided Reading (AR) automation. This plugin integrates seamlessly with the remarkable ecosystem.

## What is this?

[unified] is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees (ASTs). [remark] adds support for markdown to unified. mdast is the markdown AST that remark uses. This is a remark plugin that transforms mdast.

`remark-interactive-words` leverages abstract syntax trees (ASTs), inspecting and modifying these trees to create its interactive functionality. This plugin works with markdown as structured data, similar to how the parent tool, `remark`, operates. You can easily integrate it with your existing remark plugins to achieve a higher level of interactivity and functionality in your markdown documents.

## When should I use this?

To install the `remark-interactive-words` plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install remark-interactive-words
```

## API

After installation, you can require and use `remark-interactive-words` as follows:

```javascript
var remark = require('remark');
var interactiveWords = require('remark-interactive-words');

remark()
  .use(interactiveWords)
  .process(yourMarkdownString, function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(String(file));
  });
```

## Examples
